# INDRA Innovation & Communication Open Data Repo

## Note to Users

As a jack-of-all-trades who loves working with data, information, and computers, I work on many random projects. Some people find some of my data/info products useful. Some want my datasets, high-quality images, etc. Therefore, I created this open-source data repository.

If you have ideas on how to make this information and data more useful and user-friendly, please feel free to let me know. Please feel free to contact me at <strong>[nelynnaung {at} indramyanmar.com]</strong> if you have any questions or need further information. However, I may not be able to immediately respond to every message as I need to do some part-time gigs for a living.

## File Naming Convention

I use the following format for naming files:

`YYYY-MM-DD filename.extension`

- `YYYY`: Four-digit year
- `MM`: Two-digit month
- `DD`: Two-digit day
- `filename`: Descriptive name of the file
- `extension`: File type extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg, .pdf)
